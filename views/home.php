                <p>To promote entrepreneurial culture and mindset, skill acquisition, self-employment, economic independence and self-actualisation. The Centre’s approaches and engagements with business aim to provide insight into the tools, techniques and frameworks for managing all functional areas of business enterprises, including production, marketing, personnel and finance; developing skills of potential entrepreneurs to successfully start, expand, diversify, and manage a business enterprise as well as link them with financial institutions for start-up capital.</p>
                <p>Entrepreneurial education has been identified as the most potent tool to equip school leavers for wider employment opportunities and turn them to catalysts for job creation. It is, therefore, incumbent on the Higher Education Institutions to design training syllabuses that will be adequate and relevant to the demands of the labour market and the ever changing needs of the society. In response to this, the Federal Ministry of Education and Nigerian Universities’ Commission (NUC) have continued to encourage tertiary institutions to set up dedicated Centre for Entrepreneurship Development, to provide the missing practical workplace, skills and training that will equip graduates to be self-reliant, self-employed and become employers of labour. The challenge, therefore, is to be able to create the platform that will expose undergraduates to workplace environment, innovativeness, risk bearing, product development, business start-up and management. All these will aid technological transfer in line with the vision and mission of the University.</p>
