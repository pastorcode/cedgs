<h1>No business degree? No problem!</h1>
<p>Did you know that you don't have to have a bachelor's degree in Business to get an MBA? Lots of our students have bachelor degrees from non-business disciplines but want to learn the business skills that they'll need to succeed in their industries.&#160;</p>

<span>&#160;Here are a couple of our key features.</span></p>

                             <p>Students are taught an integrated curriculum, teaching that attempts to break down barriers between subjects and make learning more meaningful to students. Major concepts are culled from these broad themes, and activities are planned that teach or inform of these concepts.&#160; An integrated curriculum requires accessing knowledge from all of the traditional subjects without labeling them as such. In addition, an integrated curriculum adds problem solving, social consciousness and real world application to the learning process making it a more comprehensive way of educating and of learning.</p>
<p>Edwards MBA students are required to complete two modules that focus on the integration of curricula from a suite of courses.&#160; The integrative modules use a case method approach, including instruction, discussion, analysis, presentation, and writing.&#160;</p>
<p>Scheduled twice during the program, these modules provide opportunities to integrate and apply the knowledge gained in functional areas.&#160; The first module is a building block within the program utilizing concepts learned to that point, leading to the final module which integrates the entire Edwards MBA curriculum.</p>
<p>The course is a blend of short lectures, in-class case analysis and discussion as well as both group and individual case analysis. Deliverables consist of discussion case analysis hand-ins, class group presentations and written case analysis for both modules and an individual written case analysis for the final module.</p>

                             <p>The Edwards School of Business and the College of Law are pleased to announce the creation of a Dual Degree in business and in law. The program will be a three-year program allowing students to complete their law degree and their MBA simultaneously. Students will complete 39 credits in the MBA and 81 credits in the JD program for a total of 120 credits.&#160;</p>
<p>Expand Your Career Options:&#160;Students will leave the University of Saskatchewan prepared to practice either in a career in law and/ or a career in business. They will be well poised to act as corporate counsel in any large organization. The versatile skillset you gain through the JD/MBA could make you a prime candidate for high-level positions.</p>
<p>A JD/MBA can be extremely valuable for those pursing a public interest focused career path. In this sector, senior leaders are often tasked with heading a nonprofit or public institution, which requires significant management capabilities.</p>
<p>More credentials, less time.&#160;The JD /MBA Program is a 3 year program administered jointly by the Edwards School of Business and the College of Law at the University of Saskatchewan. The two degrees are complimentary and will allow students to complete two degrees in less time than if they were taken separately.&#160; (3 years versus 4) If you know you want both degrees eventually, you should consider doing them together.</p>

<p>"While completing my DVM, I discovered that I wanted to do something different than traditional veterinary practice. The MBA program provided a platform to apply skills from my unique background as well as build on new skill sets learned in the classroom from courses including leadership, finance, entrepreneurship and human resource management.&#160; In addition, the program introduced me to a very diverse group of people and facilitated networking."</p>

<p>The Edwards School of Business and the Western College of Veterinary Medicine are pleased to offer the DVM/MBA program. &#160;The DVM/MBA program is a 5-year program based on this proposal of inserting the one-year MBA program between the third and fourth year of the DVM program.&#160;</p>
<p>As veterinary medicine has become more corporate, and practice size in general is enlarging, the pharmaceutical industry and government offices continue to hire DVMs, and therefore, will all benefit from this combined DVM and business administration degree.&#160;</p>
<p>To commence the MBA program students would begin September 1st&#160;after successfully completing three years of veterinary medicine.&#160;&#160; The MBA program would run from September 1 to August 20 of the following year.&#160; Students would return to their clinical training year in the fifth year delaying completion of the DVM program by one year.&#160;</p>
<p>Make the most of your technical skills.&#160;Veterinary medicine is evolving very quickly in both companion and food animal sectors of private practice.&#160; It is quite common today to have veterinary practices in the range of 10-200 employees, and the management of such units is challenging and often requires significant human resources, financial and managerial skills.&#160; Individuals possessing strong business skills are often seriously lacking in the understanding of the animal industry, i.e., companion animal, food animal or other aspects of veterinary medicine such as corporate or government work.&#160;</p>
<p>Who is this a good fit for?&#160;The dual degree is an ideal fit for the future development of individuals who would typically be administrators in large practices or successful small business owners.&#160; Our outcomes assessment over the last 20 years has consistently shown that we are not providing enough business training within our DVM program to make our graduates comfortable in the business decisions they face in the first 2-3 years of practice.&#160; Although this degree will not make all DVM graduates business professionals, it will supplement the profession with more people to serve with human resource, financial and business management skills combined with the DVM.</p>
<h2>How to Apply</h2>
<p>Only five applicants per year are accepted to the DVM/MBA program.&#160;&#160;Students must have a four year baccalaureate degree and meet the minimum admission requirements of the MBA program, and be a current student in the WCVM at the University of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Students will be recommended by the WCVM but must meet the&#160;<a href="index.aspx#admissionrequirements">minimum requirements</a>&#160;of the MBA admissions process and will be vetted by the MBA admissions committee.&#160;</p>

Having an MBA in medicine will be beneficial in helping me understand the business implications of the decisions that physicians make. An MBA/MD will help me bridge the gap between clinical practice and business management, whether that is running a private clinic or informing government policy."</p>

<p>The Edwards School of Business and the College of Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan currently offer an MD/MBA program. This program is designed to create effective managers and teach leadership roles in the Medical profession.</p>
<p>Students admitted to the MD/MBA program would be, in effect, deferring their MD program admission by 1 year to pursue the regular-stream 12-month full-time Edwards MBA program from September to August of the year of admission.&#160;This program is only open to student who are accepted to the College of Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Who is this a good fit for?&#160;This combined degree will provide the tools and knowledge necessary for Doctors of Medicine looking to advance to a manager position in a wide range of healthcare practices. From publicly funded practices such as small local clinics and large hospital facilities to privately owned corporations in the pharma/biotechnology and health insurance industries, successful graduates of the MD/MBA program will have the medical and business knowledge needed to quickly stand out among their peers.&#160;</p>
<h2>How to Apply</h2>
<p>Up to two applicants per ear can be accepted into the dual MD/MBA stream. The MD/MBA program effectively begins at the admissions level. Students applying to the joint program must be vetted by both Colleges.&#160;Students must have completed a four year baccalaureate degree.</p>
<p>Candidates would be screened first for the MD program on the basis of academic performance (GPA) and non-academic qualities (multiple-mini interviews or MMI).&#160; Students will be recommended by the College of Medicine but must meet the&#160;<a href="index.aspx#admissionrequirements">minimum requirements</a>&#160;of the MBA admissions process and will be vetted by the MBA admissions committee.</p>
<p>Acceptance into both programs means the applicant gets a deferral on starting medicine for one year. The applicant immediately starts In the MBA Program.</p>
