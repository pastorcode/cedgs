    <p>In celebration of International Women&#8217;s Day, we spoke with several female students that are taking the lead at the Edwards School of Business. These women are leaders of different student clubs and societies, including Human Resource Students&#8217; Society, Enactus, and more. They talked about what it means to be a woman in leadership, who inspires them, the need for women supporting women, and the importance of women taking on leadership positions.</p>

Every member of our Young Women in Business (YWiB) team is truly an inspiration to me, and I love that we are able to create amazing events and content together.

<p>I think the opportunity to be in a leadership position is unlike any other. It is an opportunity for me to focus on others rather than myself and what I can do to support them to reach their goals. Being a leader forces you to stop focusing on the details and the work and instead focus on the individual and their abilities. Having been a leader for the past year, alongside my Co-President Karmyn, has challenged me and reminded me that there is so much more to being part of a team than simply getting the work done. If you focus on communication and the relationship you form with your co-workers, the work is not only finished on time, but it is finished at a far better quality, and you are able to enjoy the time spent on it.</p>

<p>I am surrounded by people who inspire me every day! I don't think I could name just one person, but rather a characteristic that I admire. I admire people who are dedicated to self-growth and determined to become the best version of themselves. Taking new opportunities and pushing yourself to try more can really help you discover yourself. The road to success is different for everyone, but it always involves a drive and wanting more.</p>

<p>I am inspired by the females in leadership I work besides. Our Edwards Business Students Society executive team is comprised mainly of females this year. These ladies are an inspiration to me as they have shown how women can thrive in leadership positions and inspire others as well. I am also inspired by my female professors, who I have had the opportunity to learn from. They have shown me how hard work and dedication pays off, and how although there are barriers for females in leadership, that it is achievable.</p>

<h2>&#160;<strong>Q:&#160;What do you think is the most significant barrier to female leadership?&#160;</strong></h2>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Karmyn Kay</strong>&#160;</p>
<p>The most significant barrier to female leadership, in my opinion, is fear. It is common for women to doubt themselves when it comes to tackling a new challenge- whether it's due to low confidence, lack of support from peers, or other personal reasons. Women supporting women is so important in order to build up that confidence that we all need when taking on a new task.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Jordan Reed</strong></p>
<p>I think one of the most significant barriers to female leadership is the gender bias that exists. This bias not only makes people more reluctant to choose a female for a leadership position, but it also makes females feel as if they are unfit for these roles. Females then feel less inclined to apply for these positions. It is an outdated and invalid argument to simply say that men are more fit for a leadership position.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Dante Carter</strong></p>
<p>I think one of the most significant barriers to female leadership is an institutional mindset that views females as having less to contribute. As women, we are constantly met with people telling us what our role should be, what knowledge we are assumed to have, and other assumptions that degrade our worth as leaders. It is important that we have women in leadership roles. As females, we do not limit ourselves by these barriers as we have so much knowledge, insight, and determination to contribute to leadership roles.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong><br/>Daniela Eichner</strong></p>
<p>I believe that the most significant barrier to female leadership is the psychological barriers that women put on themselves. I know there are many stereotypes that exist for women in leadership, such as women being far too emotional or not being assertive enough. However, if you play into these stereotypes and dwell on them, then you will not succeed. Instead, be confident and recognize that all leaders go through a learning period, and you will find your ground. In addition, if you are confident in yourself and your ability to lead, then your co-workers or employees will have confidence in you. From my experience, I was quite intimidated when offered the position of Co-President. I doubted myself and my abilities and was convinced that I was too young to co-lead a group such as YWiB. However, I decided to put aside my fears and take on this role, and I could not be more grateful that I chose to do so.</p>
</td>

<tr>

<p><strong>Katelyn&#8239;Petersen&#8239;<br/><br/></strong>Women tend to bear the emotional burden of an organization&#8217;s success. We take on more responsibility and don&#8217;t say &#8220;no&#8221; as often as we sometimes should. This creates an immense amount of stress and increases burnout that can prevent us from reaching for higher positions. Furthermore, women are sometimes hesitant to apply for leadership roles because our self-confidence is not as high as that of men.</p>

<p>My time at Edwards has exponentially made a difference in the skills that I needed to be a leader. More specifically, the professors and the students have helped me grow in these skills. Specific classes that discussed leadership and what makes a leader, such as Organizational Behaviour and Introduction to Human Resources, gave me a completely different perspective on the skills required to be a leader. I used to think that leaders needed to be perfect at the technical portions of their job; however, now I realize that having emotional intelligence and the ability to communicate is far more important. Leaders within Edwards have exemplified this in how they support their employees in their work and ensure that they were reaching their goals. The professors and students have shown me daily what it means to be a leader, and the opportunities presented through Edwards, such as leading a student group, have allowed me to grow in these skills.</p>
