After working at a public accounting firm I decided to return to full time studies and plan to merge my accounting education and experience with my newly developed legal skills to pursue a career in corporate law.</p>

                                            <p>     The MPAcc experience provided me access to effective instructors, robust curriculum, and countless opportunities to practice case writing. The degree improved my critical thinking, technical accounting, and writing skills, which enabled me to become an effective performer at KPMG and contributed to my success on the CFE where I placed on the National Honour Roll. </p>

                                            <p>The greatest gift MPAcc gave me was the ability to focus. While most CPA students struggle to balance their career and studies simultaneously, I was able to focus entirely on my career while away from MPAcc. This helped me to excel at work and fuel my career growth in a way that I highly doubt would have been possible if I had to split my efforts between work and studies. </p>
                                            <p>Similarly, while the primary focus of many CPA students is to "just get through" the course work, being away from my career enabled me to be able to focus on my MPAcc experience and learn from an outstanding group of classmates and teachers. It's an experience I look back at fondly and am extremely grateful for. </p>

                                      <p>I currently work at Medicine Hat College, located in Medicine Hat, Alberta.  I am an instructor in the Business Administration department.  This is a position that continues to challenge me as I go into my third year of teaching, as the college offers all core courses necessary for entry into the CPA Professional Education Program.  Being that we are a small department, I am therefore lucky enough to teach many different courses!   I love working with the students, and I teach everything from intro to advanced financial and managerial accounting.  I do not get bored!

                                            <p>Having an MPAcc degree on my resume has helped me stand out from the crowd, no question.  The degree shows the ambition to take an extra step to further one's education, which speaks to his/her character. This definitely gave me a leg up when applying for new positions; employers look at you differently, and even more importantly, I think you look at yourself differently too.  You have earned a master's degree, and the feeling of pride and confidence that comes with that definitely sticks with you.  The MPAcc program has helped me greatly in my career thus far, from being a Municipal Accountant, to a Controller, and now an instructor, where I can pass along much of this knowledge to new accounting students.  A master's level degree is required to teach CPA credit courses, and therefore I would not be where I am today without my MPAcc degree!</p>

We were a fairly small group and all got along well.  There was always someone around to pick you up when you felt overwhelmed, and vice versa.  And, there were many laughs to be had, whether it be late at night studying on campus or out celebrating the end of exams.  Good times and good memories!  Of course along with that goes the feeling of great accomplishment that went with completing the degree (in particular our research project)!</p>

                                      <p>How the MPAcc experience and degree helped my career is two fold.  The experience gave me a quick network of contacts throughout Saskatchewan.  As one of the rare University of Regina graduates that first year to attend MPAcc, this was vital, and one of those contacts was ultimately responsible for getting me in touch with the right people to find my first job in Bermuda.  Secondly, the MPAcc degree is recognized as an industry leader, and has opened the door to a lot more opportunities in my career than would be possible without it because many companies throughout my career have noticed that degree, researched it, and realized how much greater my education had been enhanced as a result.</p>
                                            <p><b>My greatest memory</b></p>
                                            <p>I was one of the original 19 students that took a chance on MPAcc back in 1998-99.  We were truly entering the unknown, not knowing if this was going to be for our benefit or detriment, and changing things on the fly as both ourselves as students, the professors, and the management of the program were all new to this.  We were lucky in that first year that nearly half of the program formed a touch football team that created an instant bond amongst us.  Because we were such a small group back then, group outings were common and many of those bonds remain in place to this day, 20 years later.</p>

My team helps individuals and companies that are experiencing financial difficulty to take control of their financial situation in order to give them a fresh start and put them on the road toward a positive financial future. </p>
                                       <p><b>How did your experiences at MPAcc and/or the MPAcc degree help you in your career?</b></p>
                                       <p>While the MPAcc program was certainly key to obtaining my designation as a Chartered Accountant, the program also did a lot more. It challenged me to think, to solve problems, and to be able to make decisions. It gave me access to the knowledge and experience of both the teaching staff as well as other students. You never know where your career may take you. I didn't know at that time that I would end up working in insolvency. MPAcc provided me with a well-rounded base of knowledge -  beyond accounting and tax - which has been very helpful in my career as a Licensed Insolvency Trustee. </p>

                                    <p>MPAcc was a great opportunity to meet a diverse group of new people and to get to know them on both a professional and personal level. There was a lot of time spent working together in the classroom, and no shortage of social events once class was let out! </p>

We have offices located across North America, with most of our employees based in either:  Calgary, Edmonton, Burlington, ON, London, ON, Houston, TX and Huntington Beach, CA.  I am responsible for financial stewardship of the organization as well as getting involved in solving complex internal and external problems and developing and setting long term strategic plans.  Our Company is a distributor & integrator of industrial controls with an array of clients in the process industry in Canada.  Our USA business is primarily focused on manufacturing and selling specialized equipment in the biogas sector.  As such a great deal of teamwork throughout the organization is required to deliver innovative and high quality solutions to our customers.</p>

                                      <p> MPAcc had a large focus on group projects with alot of members having varying experience and backgrounds.  With that experience I developed an ability to work and build highly functional teams, which has benefited me extensively in my career.</p>

                                            <p> My greatest memory of MPacc was the fun atmosphere.  Transitioning from articling in a Big 4 accounting firm all fall & winter to MPacc summer courses in Saskatoon gave me one last chance to not take student life for granted. Myself and my classmates spent alot of time enjoying the dakota dunes and willows golf courses in the evening, with a few Pilsner along the way.</p>

MPAcc opened up doors that have ultimately allowed me to explore and enjoy beautiful places through my work, including Southern California where I currently work.</p>
                                            <p>My favorite memory from my time in MPAcc was the annual Candle Lake weekend, which was a lot of fun for everyone, as well as the opportunities that the program gave me to build meaningful relationships with a fantastic group of some of the smartest, most talented and most fun people around (my MPAcc colleagues).</p>

                                            <p>MPAcc has provided me with a strong foundation of knowledge in all topics we covered through the MPAcc curriculum. Most importantly MPAcc pushed me to understand the theory behind why things are done to ensure I understood the material vs. simply memorizing it. I was extremely lucky to have access to such high-quality instructors during my time in the program and they were a great pillar of support to all students, showing a genuine interest in our progress.</p>

In my post-UFE job search I received feedback from interviewers and hiring managers that my Masters helped set me apart from the other candidates. </p>

I too have taken one of these opportunities, leaving PwC's Vancouver office for sunnier skies in the Cayman Islands.

<p><b>How did the experience of MPAcc and/or the MPAcc degree help you in your career?</b></p>
                                            <p>MPAcc was a highlight in my university experience. Not only were we able to graduate with an additional degree beyond our CPA but it was an incredible opportunity to build a network of friends across the country in our field. This led me to connect with a friend who had taken a similar transfer to the Caribbean and provided me with the local insight I wanted to make my decision. </p>

                                            <p>Though the small town pub crawls and camping trips were highlights in my time at MPAcc, the friends I met along the way were easily the greatest benefit of the program. What I've come to learn through this experience is that a challenge never seems quite as daunting when you're surrounded by others climbing the same mountain. Among friends and with the amazing support from the MPAcc administration, a Master's degree and a CPA designation breezed by.</p>
